                            <p class="mb-0"><br>We all know that the internet can be a dangerous place. There are scammers, hackers, but the most frequent issue we hear about is viruses, a form of malware. We’ve grown up being taught you need to have an antivirus on your computer, or else you will get viruses. This is also pushed by antivirus companies themselves (for obvious financial reasons) and these services do everything possible to latch onto your computer, as made famous by John McAfee himself.<br><br>Let’s start with the pro to antiviruses: They are generally good for your security. They continually scan your system for malware and vulnerabilities, they check every websites you visit, scan email attachments, and they can sometimes include tools like password managers and payment- specific security features.<br><br></p>

                    <p><br>But it is probably one of the worst things you can do for your privacy. Antiviruses need to scan every file on your computer, every website you visit, and all of your personal data. They almost always collect everything flowing in and out of your computer, and admit to collecting this information. Go read your antivirus’s privacy policy on their website.<br><br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Extra Information</h2>
                    <p><br>Every user will have different options, and to figure out where you should go from here, there are three things you need to answer:<br><br>1)&nbsp;<br>How strong is your ability to download from trusted sources with no malicious intent? If you aren’t sure, then assume it’s not good.<br><br>2)&nbsp;<br>What operating system are you using? Are you on Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS, Linux, or something else? Different platforms have better security than others, which may impact the need for an antivirus.<br><br>3)&nbsp;<br>How good are your browsing habits? I covered these tips in our recent lesson teaching the basic rules to avoid viruses, scams, and hackers from invading your system.<br><br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/tech-2020-apps-vr-bitcoin.jpg">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Apple and IOS</h2>
                    <p><br>For MacOS, the likelihood of an infection is generally smaller than Windows because it is a less targeted OS.<br><br>On iOS, no antiviruses, ever. Anything that claims it’s protecting you is doing more harm than good. iOS does not need an antivirus thanks to Apple’s heavy restrictions on what apps can be downloaded to the device.<br><br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Android</h2>
                    <p><br>Android devices are a bit more open than iPhones. If you’re moderate or advanced, you don’t need anything. If you’re a beginner, you CAN get one if you download 3rd-party apps frequently, but it’s honestly still not recommended.<br><br></p><a href="#"></a>
